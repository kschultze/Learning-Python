Readme.txt for Learning-Python repository.

This is a place where I'm storing all my assignments and related files while I go through MIT's 6.00 online class from Fall 2007, "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming"

I'm not taking the class formally, just going through the video lectures and doing the assignments.  Thus I don't always follow every instruction in the assignments exactly.

My level of programming experience coming into this class is pretty limitted.  I have done a small to moderate amount of matlab programming and tinkered around with python a bit.  Little to no formal training but picked up a bit of background on basic data structures and programming tools (loops, if statements, etc.)

I encourage any constructive criticism that you think would help me learn!
